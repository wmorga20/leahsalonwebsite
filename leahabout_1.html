             <h1>About Leah</h1>
             <p>  Leah was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and moved to Atlanta in 2001 with her family. As a young child Leah would pick up a barbie doll and began to braid as if it was nothing. Right then, she knew she was destined to be in the beauty industry.

              Leah then attended McEachern Highschool where she took a cosmetology course to get the ball rolling. In high school, Leah grew an interest for makeup. She would do her friends faces for prom and school activities.
              
              In 2013 Leah thought she would go to college but Godâ€™s Plan took her directly to beauty school.
              
              In 2014 she enrolled to Empire Beauty School and her talent really took flight. Hair was just a hobby to Leah but now its a passion. Leah graduated Empire with honors and was accepted the award for student of year for 2014. 
              
              Her career took flight at Kbb Salon in 2015 where her mentor Kalena Duru taught her how not only to slay but to cater to every single person who sits in the chair, because they are the heart of the business! You are why we are who we are!
              
              Leah believes that beauty begins with you!!! You are the heart of this brand and we are here to service you!</p>
